# CitationChecker

This script will parse your usage of citations from a latex file. It will tell you the frequecy and location (line number/s) of each citation. Very useful if you are over-citing specific papers.

### HOW TO RUN?
Paste your latex in the file "paste_latex_here"

run: python counter.py
